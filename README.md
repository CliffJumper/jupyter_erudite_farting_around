# jupyter_erudite_farting_around

## Why?

This repo is for demonstrating, via a jupyter notebook, how to setup and add kernels for other languages

## How?

### Initial steps

I did this with python 3.8.2, so you'll have your best luck setting up a virtualenv / pyenv / whatever and:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### What then?

See the notebook, it's really its own presentation
